This repository details a Service Management System developed during the first semester of the FATEC Analysis and Systems Development (ADS) course. This project was the final assessment for the "Programação em Microinformática" (Microinformatics Programming) discipline.

Project Purpose: Practical VBA and Database Application
The core objective was to apply introductory programming and database management concepts by creating a functional, single-user system tailored for a specialized service niche: Luthier and Guitar Technician (Guitar Tech) services.

The system focused on organizing the service workflow, transitioning from manual or paper-based methods to a structured digital solution.
